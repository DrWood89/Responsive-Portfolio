            Hello! My name's Wood Jerry as stated above but everyone calls me DjeDje. i was born and raised in the beautiful carribean
            country of Haiti. Where i knew many beautiful moments but life in Haiti can be vey challenging... From hunger,
            abuse, corruption, poverty to natural disasters i've seen it all. It was not an easy existence but one that taught
            me strength through adversity as well as the importance of hard work and dedication. I would not change my heritage
            for anything- it made me who i am today.
        </p>
        <p class="bio">
            I have lived in the states for about three years most of that time has been spent here in Utah. I work in Construction and
            though i've learned a lot i can't wait for the day i can exchange my toolbelt for my laptop! Technology (Specially
            coding) has always fascinated me and i look forward to becoming completely immersed in a career of web design
            and development.
        </p>
        <p class="bio">
            On a more personal note, i have an adventurous spirit and i love the oiutdoors, especially in the summer.If i could spend
            everyday in the mountains i would. i also have a passion for music. i'm a singer/sonmgwriter i record and produce
            my own songs. most of my music is sung and perform in Haitian Ceole. I love sharing the sound and feel of my
            beloved homeland through my music.
        </p>
